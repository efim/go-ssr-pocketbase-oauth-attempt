#+title: Auth Notes
* starting the pocketbase as framework
https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-overview/
* plan
** DONE start pocketbase
** DONE add middlewares for cookie session
** DONE add index page, that will have either "current user" or 'login' link
*** DONE let's add some content that only opens up when person is authed
*** DONE also, how do i logout?
separate route that deleted the cookie i guess.
since auth is a jwt which would expire on its own
and htmx get thingy, and reload i guess?
** DONE 'login' link should open dialog with oauth providers
so, i want a window with available oauth providers,
to trigger the js code from example
https://pocketbase.io/docs/authentication/
( all in one, recommended )

let's get configured providers in the go code,
add as slice of strings, and in template create buttons for each of those
with js code from the example
*** DONE in template range over enabled providers to create buttons for each
*** DONE make dialog show on click of some element
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dialog
** TODO i guess i would also like to send htmx event for reloading the page
on successful auth?
** TODO add one more page that checks auth
** TODO add tailwind styling
** TODO package static into single binary
** TODO write nix build
** TODO write nixos module
** TODO add docker image from nix
*** TODO add cli for port and host
** TODO add readme and comments
** TODO configure tls / ssl / https on franzk deployment
can it be configured on render.com?
