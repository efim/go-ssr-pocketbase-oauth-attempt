#+title: Auth Notes
* starting the pocketbase as framework
https://pocketbase.io/docs/go-overview/
* plan
** DONE start pocketbase
** DONE add middlewares for cookie session
** DONE add index page, that will have either "current user" or 'login' link
*** DONE let's add some content that only opens up when person is authed
*** DONE also, how do i logout?
separate route that deleted the cookie i guess.
since auth is a jwt which would expire on its own
and htmx get thingy, and reload i guess?
** DONE 'login' link should open dialog with oauth providers
so, i want a window with available oauth providers,
to trigger the js code from example
https://pocketbase.io/docs/authentication/
( all in one, recommended )

let's get configured providers in the go code,
add as slice of strings, and in template create buttons for each of those
with js code from the example
*** DONE in template range over enabled providers to create buttons for each
*** DONE make dialog show on click of some element
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dialog
** DONE i guess i would also like to send htmx event for reloading the page
on successful auth?
now, why would logout work, and login not work?

eh, let's go back on body doing the hx-get on event?

maybe this is because of open dialog
*** wait, maybe then returning from other auth middlewares will work
no.
for some reason
#+begin_src go
e.HttpContext.Response().Header().Add("HX-Trigger", "auth-change-event")
#+end_src

this header when returned with response to request triggered by js, doesn't result in event being triggered,
ok, i guess
*** so yeah, uglier that i wanted
wanted to have hx-get="/" hx-trigger="auth-change-event"
and send these events from all auth middleware methods

https://htmx.org/docs/#response-headers

but on auth success, even though header is present in the response, no event is triggered
( checked with event listener in console )
so, yup. coupling between js code of oauth, middlewares and body tag. this seems like too much.

but it somewhat works

** TODO add one more page that checks auth
and let's use existing middleware from framework documentation
** TODO add tailwind styling
** TODO package static into single binary
** TODO write nix build
** TODO write nixos module
** TODO add docker image from nix
*** TODO add cli for port and host
** TODO add readme and comments
** TODO configure tls / ssl / https on franzk deployment
can it be configured on render.com?
